# contentful-extension
First time trying out building a Contentful extension

Bootstrapped with contentful cli: 
https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-extension

## First time starting the project
```
npm install
npm run login && npm run configure
npm run start
```

The config for Contentful will end up in your user directory in a file called .contentfulrc.json

A good video describing how this all works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FsWUpGlzI8
